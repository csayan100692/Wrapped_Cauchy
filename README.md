#"PBTWRPCAUCHYT1" is the function for finding the test statistic value and the critical value of the given dataset using circular mean as an estimator of the population mean. For evaluating this function we just need to give the dataset and nominal significance level as input and this function will give the output as the test statistic value and the critical value. Based on these two values we may decide whether we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis H_0: \mu=\mu_0.



#"PBTWRPCAUCHYT2" is the function for finding the test statistic value and the critical value of the given dataset using the mle as an estimator of the wrapped Cauchy distribution. For evaluating this function we just need to give the dataset and nominal significance level as input and this function will give the output as the test statistic value and the critical value. Based on these two values we may decide whether we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis H_0: \mu=\mu_0.

#"PBTWRPCAUCHYT3" is the function for finding the test statistic value and the critical value of the given dataset using circular median as an estimator of the population mean. For evaluating this function we just need to give the dataset and nominal significance level as input and this function will give the output as the test statistic value and the critical value. Based on these two values we may decide whether we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis H_0: \mu=\mu_0.


#"PBTWRPCAUCHYCP1" is the function for finding the coverage probability and average length of the confidence interval of the mean direction of a wrapped Cauchy distribution based on the method PBTM.

#"PBTWRPCAUCHYCP2" is the function for finding the coverage probability and average length of the confidence interval of the mean direction of a wrapped Cauchy distribution based on the method PBML.

#"PBTWRPCAUCHYCP3" is the function for finding the coverage probability and average length of the confidence interval of the mean direction of a wrapped Cauchy distribution based on the method PBCM.
